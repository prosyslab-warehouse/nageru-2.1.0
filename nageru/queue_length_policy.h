// A class to estimate the future jitter. Used in QueueLengthPolicy (see below).
//
// There are many ways to estimate jitter; I've tested a few ones (and also
// some algorithms that don't explicitly model jitter) with different
// parameters on some real-life data in experiments/queue_drop_policy.cpp.
// This is one based on simple order statistics where I've added some margin in
// the number of starvation events; I believe that about one every hour would
// probably be acceptable, but this one typically goes lower than that, at the
// cost of 2â€“3 ms extra latency. (If the queue is hard-limited to one frame, it's
// possible to get ~10 ms further down, but this would mean framedrops every
// second or so.) The general strategy is: Take the 99.9-percentile jitter over
// last 5000 frames, multiply by two, and that's our worst-case jitter
// estimate. The fact that we're not using the max value means that we could
// actually even throw away very late frames immediately, which means we only
// get one user-visible event instead of seeing something both when the frame
// arrives late (duplicate frame) and then again when we drop.

// For any card that's not the master (where we pick out the frames as they
// come, as fast as we can process), there's going to be a queue. The question
// is when we should drop frames from that queue (apart from the obvious
// dropping if the 16-frame queue should become full), especially given that
// the frame rate could be lower or higher than the master (either subtly or
// dramatically). We have two (conflicting) demands:
//
//   1. We want to avoid starving the queue.
//   2. We don't want to add more delay than is needed.
//
// Our general strategy is to drop as many frames as we can (helping for #2)
// that we think is safe for #1 given jitter. To this end, we measure the
// deviation from the expected arrival time for all cards, and use that for
// continuous jitter estimation.
//
// We then drop everything from the queue that we're sure we won't need to
// serve the output in the time before the next frame arrives. Typically,
// this means the queue will contain 0 or 1 frames, although more is also
// possible if the jitter is very high.
